## Project Description
"Life Simulation Monopoly" is an AI-generated life simulation game demo that combines a Monopoly-style gameplay with AI-generated life events. Players roll the dice to progress through different stages of life, experiencing unique AI-created stories along the way.

Project Inspiration:
While working on an LLM (Large Language Model) project, I became curious about the kinds of life stories an LLM could generate. This led me to develop this demo as an experiment to explore the creativity and limitations of LLMs.

In the initial version, I let the LLM generate all character attributes. However, even with strict constraints in the prompts, it often produced illogical results, such as a 5-year-old CEO or a 100-year-old elementary school studentü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

To address this, I later restricted numerical values while allowing the LLM to focus solely on text generation (such as career, personality, and events). Attributes like wealth, health, and social skills are now controlled by game logic.

In this game, you will experience interesting life stories, which the AI serves as the writer and director, crafting a unique cyber life simulation. However, due to the limitations of the LLM model, some AI-generated stories may be less than perfect. I appreciate your understanding!üòÜ

## Gameplay
1. Click "Start Game", and the character will be randomly assigned a gender and initial attributes.
2. Click "Roll Dice", the character's age will increase by 1-10 years, and they will move forward accordingly.
3. Landing on a tile triggers an AI-generated event, affecting the character's wealth, career, social skills, and more. However, since the game calls the LLM API and waits for a response, there may be a 2-4 second delayüòî before the event text appears. Once the AI-generated content is received, the event window will automatically pop up.

4. A footprint icon ![alt text](readmeImg/tile_0078.png)will appear where the character lands. Clicking it allows you to review the historical event that occurred at this position.

5. If health drops to 0, the AI will generate a death event, and the game will end.

6. The right-side panel displays the character's current attributes and recent events.
